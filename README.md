# 2DBrickGame
A brickbreaker game I created using unity with some C# scripts.  
The game includes has a Main Menu and has 2 levels.  Each level has a certain number of bricks and the player has to use the arrow keys to control the paddle, in order to hit the ball and let it rebound to break the breaks and so forth.
If you decide you want to make any changes, work away, as this was simply a small project on the side.
How to get Running:
Once pulled, open the project using Unity.  Then open the project and select the scene "MainMenu."  Then select the Play button and you will be brought to the main menu.
